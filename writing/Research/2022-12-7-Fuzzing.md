## Fuzzers: A survey

|                  | Easy to start | Priori knowledge        | coverage                        | ability to pass validation |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Generation based | hard          | needed, hard to acquire | high                            | strong                     |
| Mutation based   | easy          | not needed              | low, affected by initial inputs | weak                       |

| Fuzzers   |                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| White box | have access to the source code                               |
| Gray box  | without source code and gain the internal information of target programs through program analysis |
| Black box | without any knowledge on target program internals            |

通常采用代码覆盖率来衡量Fuzzing：以基本块为单位作为衡量

1. counting the executed basic blocks
2. counting the basic block transitions
